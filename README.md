<h1>A collection Of Exprements the goal of thies Experements varies but it mainly fouces on Concepts that is obsecure </h1>

<h2>Experiments:</h2>
</br>
<h3>1- Interior Mapping</h3>
</br>
</br>
<p>the cube maps that are in spider man are great, recreated a simpler version of it in this experement</p>
<h3>2- Parallax Effect</h3>
<br>
<p>Created optimized Parallax effect where I did use the frustum culling technique to limit the computations to the distance of the camera and what the camera sees</p>
</br>
<h3>3-Toon shading </h3>
<br>
<p>Created version of toon shading that is optimized and created a global render pass tp create the black outlines using horizontal and vertical edge detection</p>
</br>
<h3>4-Relialistic water </h3>
<br>
<p>making realistic water is a cool thing I always wanted to explore here is a IN PROGRESS realistic water and I am planning to finish it </p>
</br>
<h3>5- stylized shading</h3>
<br>
<p>Unities tutorial on  Stylized shading was very dense and full of informations the result is fantastic and worth it if that is what you are looking for </p>
</br>
<h3>6- Procedual Anmation Creation</h3>
<br>
<p> when I saw a video on the science behined snake animation and movement I wanted to make the mechanics so bad so I made a chain 
<br>
with distance and angle constraints with it you can make a lot of things from dragon and snake to big game ideas that mainly uses this techneque </p>
</br>
<h3>7- Pong </h3>
<br>
<p>I wanted to make sure I truly understand and able to work with the object bounds its simple concept but its tricky in its implementation so I made a pong prototype </p>
<br>
<h3>8- Spline tool</h3>
<br>
<p>If you want to use something you have to understand it and there is no better way to understand splines other
</br>
than make spline editor so I made simple one and that made me  understand the limitations of splines and that helped me in the nex experement</p>
</br>
<h3>9- Uncharted 4 Founders Puzzle</h3>
<br>
<p>dont get too excited its not as good as the original but when I saw it in uncharted 4 all I wanted is to make it because when u solve a part the next part is differant and the places of the other plates ar differant and that made it truly interesting and I wanted to make it and I think I made a good job at capturing the original </p>
